# Extreme programming and scrum
1. Pair programming is a good way to reduce bug when developing code. I.e. after the specification, let two programmers edit the same program, however, one program is writing and another one is looking for error, doing so can reduces the chances of error. After a period of time, two programmers switch places.

## Dynamic programming

1. Make it work
- Visualize problem as tree
- Implement tree using recursion(Stack)
- Testing it

2. Make it efficient
- Adding a memo object
- Add base case to return values into the memo.
-  Store return values into the memo, BEWARE of the KEY.

>!DO THESE 1 BY 1, DONT JUMP TOO FAST TO SOLUTION.

## Design methologies
1. Use Hierarchical methods to solve problems.
